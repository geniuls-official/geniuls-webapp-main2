ISA  at Geniuls is a contract between students and Geniuls where you commit to pay a set amount for some months. Only after you are placed for 7LPA and above you start paying Geniuls back.<br/>You do not pay us anything if you do not receive the desired result, which is a job paying at least INR 7,00,000 (CTC). In that case your education is totally free.</div>

      <div class="accordion-body">As per the ISA, you will be legally bound to furnish all the income relevant documents such as Offer Letter, Salary Slips, Income Tax Returns, Bank Statements, etc. to Geniuls. Also fee collection happens through a NBFC partner. In case of voluntary non-payments, the NBFC will initiate legal action to recover the pending payments.
